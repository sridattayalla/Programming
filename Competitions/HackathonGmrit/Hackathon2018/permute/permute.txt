Q) Form a Permutation!

There is an array with elements from 1 to n. Now the task is to change(replace) minimum number of elements in that array such that it forms a permutation i.e., each of the integers from 1 to n must be encountered in the array exactly once. 

In case of more than one solution find the permutation which is lexicographically minimum

In order to determine which of the two permutations is lexicographically smaller, we compare their first elements. If they are equal — compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutations x and y, then x is lexicographically smaller 
if xi <yi, where i is the first index in which the permutations x and y differ.

Input:
Input is a file which contains 2 lines.
The first line will contain the number of elements in the array
The second line will contain the elements of the array

Output:
First line must contain the minimum number of elements that need to be changed
Second line must contain the permutation which is lexicographically minimum and obtained from the array.

Example 1:

Input:
4
3 2 2 3

Output:
2
1 2 4 3

Example 2:

Input:
6
4 5 6 3 2 1

Output:
0
4 5 6 3 2 1 

Explantion:
In first case the different possibilities with 2 changes/replacements are 1 2 4 3 , 3 2 1 4, 3 2 4 1 
amonst all 1 2 4 3 is the lexicographically smallest permutation.
In second case there is no need of any change because the given array is already a permutation.
