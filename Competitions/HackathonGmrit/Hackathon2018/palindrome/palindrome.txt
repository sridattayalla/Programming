Output:53435

Example2:

Input:-g4e3e5k3s4

Example3:

Input:-nu23m-2

Explanation:
In case 1 from the given string after removing all the alphabets and special characters we get 35453 and next greater palindrome that can be formed from that number is 53435
In case 3 after removing all spl characters the number is -232 and no palindrome can be formed so -1
