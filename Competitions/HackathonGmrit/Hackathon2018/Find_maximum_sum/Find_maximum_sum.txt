Q) Find maximum sum

A and B are 2 arrays with 'N' elements say a1,a2,...an and b1,b2,...bn resp. 
For any pair (i, j) with i, j ϵ {1, 2, ..., N} we define the segment from i to j, written as seg[i, j], to be 
if i ≤ j  seg[i,j] = {i, i + 1, ..., j} 
if i > j seg[i,j] = {i, i + 1, ..., N, 1, 2, ...,j} 

Thus if N = 5 then the seg[2, 4] = {2, 3, 4} and seg[4, 2] = {4, 5, 1, 2}.

With each seg[i, j] we associate a formula sum[i, j] to calculate the sum :

If i==j then, sum[i, i] = ai.
If i ≠ j then,  sum[i, j] = ai + aj +  ∑ bk where k ϵ seg[i,j] and k!=i,j 

The positions i and j contribute ai and aj to the sum while every other position k in seg[i, j] contributes bk.

The task is to find the maximum sum.

Input:
Input is a file which contains 3 lines
The first line contains a single positive integer N.
Second line contains N integers of array A and
Third line contains N integers of array B

Output:

3 integer's in a single line giving the segment index i.e., i and j and the maximum possible special segment sum.

Example:

Input:
5
2 3 2 3 1
3 4 4 6 3

Output:
2 1 18

Explanation:
sum[1, 1] = 2, sum[2, 4] = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 and sum[4, 2] = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. ..so on...sum[2, 1] = 18
